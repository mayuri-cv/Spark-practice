I would like to talk about a project where I made a major contrbution

Client was in property lease,  meter management for several utilities 
so we have developed a soultion to provide end to end service to addess his requirements

Data was inserted from MySQL to hdfs using sqoop,
 it was processed in an on-premises cluster with a pyspark job, and data was stored in the hive table for
 downstream processing and dashboarding
 Our key datasources were CSV files, mysql database
 For version control git was used and unit testing was done with pytest
 As a part of this project, I was involved in ETL pipeline, coding (spark transformations , joins, actions and all)
 Debugging was taken care during the creation of Data Frames and performing transformations
 And for end to end monitoring we have used log files and spark UI
 
 Right now working on the innersource project data-comparator
 In big data engineering we migrate data from existing system to new system.
and not sure whether data is migrated successfully or not ..
to address this problem we are desiging a generic tool which can compare the existing dataset and migrated dataset
In data-comaprator we are using pyspark, postgresql ..
